<title>Website Entry #1: Cinematic Realism</title>
<header><b>Website Entry #1: Cinematic Realism:</b></header>

<p><b>Early theories of film gave rise to what are described as “the realist tendencies” of the medium.  What is meant by “cinematic realism”?  
    How do various authors we have read either forward or critique the relationship of aesthetic realism and the moving image?  
    Your response should describe what you think Cinematic Realism is, with specific reference to readings from the course. You 
    should also offer your own views on the topic, including what properties you think make cinema more realistic – and if you think this 
    can or should be a goal to pursue. Include in your discussion specific analysis of a clip that you choose to analyze, either advocating 
    for or critiquing ideas of realism. This should be different from the clips we've discussed in class. Include visuals in your web entry! 
    Film stills! Photographs of topics or people you discuss! Also try to use thumbnails rather the url links when possible.
    Include this post in your blog and submit the link here.  This post should be in the neighborhood of 500-600 words though can certainly be longer.</b></p>

    <title>Website Entry #2: Genre and Spectatorship</title>
    <header><b>Website Entry #2: Genre and Spectatorship:</b></header>
    <p><b>View in its entirety a film that seems to fit within a specific genre and/or provides a good sustained example of the "male gaze." 
        (Though not relevant for most, I’ve included examples from the SMC Library to give you a sense). Then write a brief (500-600 words) 
        analysis of the film connecting how it approaches issues of mise-en-scene with larger questions of genre or the male gaze. Your
         analysis should directly engage with at least Neale, Williams, or Mulvey. Bringing in multiple readings can be helpful. You may 
         certainly include ideas from multiple authors, especially those quoted in articles or discussed in class (e.g., Altman, which 
         would be a good choice). Be sure to analyze in specific detail at least one scene as it demonstrates your larger thesis about 
         what genre is and how it is working in your chosen example. You can choose any film that you think will work, but are encouraged 
         to choose with genre in mind, rather than force a genre argument onto a film you happen to have watched recently.</b></p>

    <title>Website Entry #3: Genre and Video Production Technique</title>
    <header><b>Website Entry #3: Genre and Video Production Technique:</b></header>
    <p><b> For this blog post, you will create two short (about 1 minute or less) videos. Each video should be a “genre exercise,” which means 
        you should pick a genre and tell a story that works within your understanding of that genre. Think in terms of the semantic/syntactic 
        approach and/or body genres discussed in class. Both of your videos should be within the same genre. The difference is that one should 
        be a continuity narrative with a range of at least three shots (e.g., long shot, medium shot, close-up, etc.,.) while the other short should 
        be montage. In your post, in addition to embedding your videos, you should then explain what makes these genre works and continuity/montage 
        in a few brief sentences with specific reference to these concepts as discussed in class. (The overall goal, then, is to show both in concept 
        and practice that you know what genre, continuity, and montage are and how they work). These are not expected to be masterworks. The precision 
        of the edits, for example, is far less important than your conceptualization and some attention to mise-en-scene and shot composition. The goal, 
        again, is for you to both reflect upon and apply technique in range of conceptual and practice-based arenas. Your description of why your works 
        fit into a specific genre and specific film technique (think in terms of writing an artist’s statement about your own work) is as important as 
        the images themselves.</b></p>
    <title>Website Entry #4: Photography</title>
    <header><b>Website Entry #4: Photography:</b></header>
    <p><b>Your primary goal here is to engage with, via the production and analysis of photographic images, Susan Sontag and/or Jack Halberstam’s writings on photography. After reading the articles and reviewing the slides, use insights gleaned to produce a set of new, original photographs that profile either a person, place, or activity/practice. Include at least five photographs, though more is fine.
        Your photo series should center on a profile of a specific person or a specific place or specific cultural practice. (Self-portraiture is acceptable). You can interpret this prompt broadly and creative - the larger point is some sense of thematic of conceptually unity across the project. (The images shouldn't be random!) You should be revealing or sharing something visually of your subject with your audience. (Think back to many of the examples we looked at in class.)
        Embed your photographs in your website. Then analyze the photographs - either individually or as a collection - by directly incorporating insights from Sontag and/or Halberstam. How does photography work, generally, according to either of these authors? (That is, how do they analyze or theorize the way photography works?). Is your photograph, specifically, functioning in any of these ways? (Note: a critique of either or both authors is perfectly acceptable). Some key concepts to think about here are the production of reality, objectivity/subjectivity debates, temporality (time), and, especially,  identity. (Also important: Halberstam writes about specific identities, but offers insights that are applicable to identity via photography more broadly. You are not bound to the identities discussed in that article).
        You descriptions of your photographs can be pretty short (~100 words each) but should engage directly with ideas from the class. You may also (or instead) think of this web entry in terms of the total words, which should be roughly between 300-400 words. You may be better served writing a longer intro and then only short amounts about each entry. The choice of how to relate words and images is yours. 
        An additional goal is to demonstrate that you can take a photo incorporating composition techniques. You should be mindful of some of the techniques we have explored in class. You do not need to describe your technical choices in the web entry.</b></p>
    <title>Website Entry #5: Posthumanism</title>
    <header><b>Website Entry #5: Posthumanism:</b></header>
    <p><b> Her, by Spike Jonze, can be seen to exemplify - and perhaps 
        critique - many of the conceptual traits of posthumanism.  
        In her work, How We Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles 
        provides us with both a schematic and richly descriptive view 
        of a trajectory toward a posthuman framework.  In this web post 
        you are to use Hayles’ writing to analyze the film Her.  That 
        is, draw specific examples of Hayles’ conceptualization of 
        posthumanism and apply it to specific scenes from the film.  
        Your web entry should offer both a larger statement on the 
        film as a posthuman text and detailed analysis of specific 
        scenes (or one scene). (Note: you may disagree with my assertion 
        of the film as emblematic of posthuman concerns.  If so, you are 
        quite free to argue to the contrary).</b></p>
