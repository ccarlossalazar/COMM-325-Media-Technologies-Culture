<h1>Comm-325-Media-Technologies-Culture</h1>
<p>This is a website I created with HTML, CSS, and the use of frameworks such as BOOTSTRAP for my Comm-325 course. We had to create a  
website to log our course website entries. The website entries are based on different prompts provided by the instructor. I decided to
create a simple website that includes a main-page, about-me, contact, and a website entries tab.</p>
