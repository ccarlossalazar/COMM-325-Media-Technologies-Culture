    <p style="text-indent: 30px;" class="p-4"> <b>In, <i>How We Became Posthuman</i>, 
        by N. Katherine Hayles, Hayles focuses heavily on the understanding of 
        being human in a world where technology is steadily advancing. Not only 
        is it advancing, it is taking over very important parts of our lives and 
        she explains how this might change the idea of what it truly means to be 
        human and transitioning to post-human. She gives a definition of posthumanism 
        which stems from the idea of the human transitioning to an informational 
        entity which is different from what our notions are about humans now as 
        a biological one. She states that, “the posthuman view privileges informational 
        pattern over material instantiation, so that embodiment in a
        biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than an 
        inevitability of life.” (Hayles 2). Although she does agree with the notion 
        that humans are increasingly becoming more understood as informational 
        beings, she does not agree that the “embodiment in a biological substrate 
        is seen as an accident of history”. This idea that humans are increasingly 
        being understood as informational beings is highlighted throughout the movie 
        <i>Her</i>, by Spike Jonze. Theodore, the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix, 
        falls in love with an OS, Samantha who essentially is able to act as a living 
        form although lacking a physical form. As Theodore begins to develop feelings 
        for her as does she, which highlights her idea of reflexivity and referencing 
        the third wave of cybernetics specifically in which, “the rapidly emerging field 
        of artificial life, computer programs are designed to allow "creatures" to 
        evolve spontaneously in directions the programmer may not have anticipated” 
        (Hayles 11). This can be seen through Samantha developing feelings for Theodore
         which is beyond what she might have originally been programmed to do and 
         forming her own sense of consciousness. Another example of the issues that 
         Hayles expresses about posthumanism is the idea that human interactions 
         with technology and machines becomes a crucial aspect of developing identity 
         in a posthuman world. This can be seen once again as Theodore relies 
         heavily on the presence of Samantha and the role she plays in his emotional 
         development and his overall self development and his identity. A specific 
         scene that highlights this would be when they make love although be it not 
         physical, the emotions are still felt and expressed by both parties although 
         Samantha is not what someone would consider ‘human’. This challenges traditional
          norms of human intimacy what Hayles critiques about the posthuman world. This is 
          a movie that I believe was very ahead of its time and is not too far from 
          our present reality. We have introduction of a number of different forms of 
          AI which are able to complete a number of different tasks in the most efficient 
          way possible. Similarly, we have ChatGPT for example which is evolving at an 
          incredible rate which can now train itself and learn from its own mistakes. 
          The movie <i>Her</i>, does an exceptional job of highlighting the impacts a 
          posthuman world can have on the one’s sense of self aswell as the clear 
          limitations of technology when it come’s to replicating human life-forms.
