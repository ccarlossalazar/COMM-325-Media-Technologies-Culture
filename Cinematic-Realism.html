</div>
</div>

    <p style="text-indent: 30px;" class="p-4"> <b>When thinking about “cinematic realism” it refers to the style of 
        filmmaking that aims to portray real feelings and events through 
        specific characters and settings. In other words, it means keeping 
        film simple as a means to make it feel more real to the audience as 
        opposed to using excessive elements that make the film feel more unnatural. 
        In our class, we have looked at two very important individuals who 
        played a key role in the development of cinematic realism. We examined 
        the theories of Siegfried Kracauer and Andrew Bazin, who are regarded 
        as two of the most influential film theorists that developed many key 
        ideas about cinematic realism. Cinematic realism to me means how accurate 
        something is when it comes to film. Oftentimes in film you might 
        notice scenes that don’t feel as normal, whether it is what the 
        characters do or perhaps an event is just captured incorrectly. 
        However, there are also films that hit the nail on the head and 
        do a great job of making you feel like you yourself are experiencing 
        that moment. Some things that I think are essential for making a 
        film more realistic are definitely the smaller details in an event 
        or in other words consistency and continuity. This can be expressed 
        through different shot selections like conversation shots in films 
        when you get the perspective of all parties involved in a conversation 
        and the different shots presented in a single scene. An example of this 
        can be the scene we examined in class from the movie, “Social Network” and 
        the use of different shots in the opening scene when the two characters are 
        having a conversation and we can see both of their perspectives. A scene 
        I decided to examine was from the movie, “The Meyerowitz Stories”, in 
        which we see the characters having a conversation and there is an open 
        shot where the scene is captured and then transitions to close up shots 
        of everyone's point of view during the conversation. I believe this is 
        the vision that both Kracauer and Bazin share when it comes to cinematic 
        realism although they express it a little differently. Kracauer focused 
        more on the artistic approach of film by, “outlining the inherent 
        similarities between photography and cinema, pointing out that cinema 
        can be considered to be simply the next step in the evolution of photography. 
        So, it follows that like a photograph, “a film is realistic because it 
        correctly reproduces that part of the real world to which it refers” 
        (Kracauer 299). His ideas around cinematic realism revolved around using 
        realistic representations in film to portray this realism. Similarly, 
        Bazin focused, “on Renoir’s penchant for the “long-take, deep-focus” 
        style (Bazin). Bazin is insistent that this is the most true-to-form 
        style of cinematic realism, and this assertion is entirely coherent 
        with Kracauer’s Cinematic Approach.” (Edwards, 3). Bazin focused on 
        capturing film in a way that was natural and making it a more immersive 
        experience for the audience. Personally, I agreed a lot with Gregory 
        Currie’s view of cinematic realism and how he did not directly disagree 
        with the previous two theorists but believed cinematic realism involves 
        a number of different approaches that can be used to represent reality 
        instead of simply capturing a direct reflection of the real world. 
        Currie states that, “The ‘long-take, deep-focus’ style is actually 
        no more realistic in a cognitive sense than are other styles – say
         those employing soft focus or disjunctive editing techniques. And 
         this is because the ‘long-take, deep-focus’ style requires a much 
         smaller aperture size to render images, meaning the human eye would 
         in fact not be able to perceive these images in the same way as the 
         camera does under the same conditions (Currie 55).

<p><b>This is an image of the Lumière brothers, who were known for manufacturing photography equipment.
    They were also known for their short films and were amongst the earliest filmmakers. Both Andrew Bazin and Siegfried Kracauer
    agreed that the brothers played a foundational role for realism in film.</b></p>

<p><b>This is a scene from the movie 'The Meyerowitz Stories', which I examined to be a great example
    of cinematic realism. We can see a number of shots in this film ranging from long-shot, medium-shot, 
    over-the-shoulder shot and continuity. This blend of shots allows for the film to feel more realistic.

<p><b>This is a scene from the intro to the movie, 'The Social Network'. This was a scene we examined in class
    that does a good job of capturing the characters' conversation through the use of a medium-shot, shot-reverse 
    shot, and over-the-shoulder shots. This sequence of shots allows to capture the conversation accurately creating an immersive experience to the audience.</b></p>

<p><b>This is a scene from the movie, 'Boyhood'. This is another example of a movie that does well with capturing
    the concept of cinematic realism. In this clip from the movie you can see the variety of shots being used to 
    capture the conversation of the characters which allows for a more realistic feel to the movie.

<hr>
<div class="container p-1">
<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">"It is for this reason that no grand theory such as ‘Cinematic Realism’ should ever be considered as purporting to be definitive and all encompassing – even if the author impels this conclusion. Rather, any theory should be used as an analytical tool for a task which it is best suited. If thought of in this way, any self-contained theoretical framework can contribute to significant enlightenment in a given area of study. Thus, Kracauer’s initial thesis is not incorrect, but it must be considered in light of its inherent limitations. (Edwards 6)"</h5>
<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">“Everything depends on the “right” balance between the realistic tendency and the formative tendency; and the two tendencies are well balanced if the latter does not overwhelm the former but eventually follows its lead” (Kracauer 298).</h5>
<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">"This is to say that staged shots should create the visual impression of the real world as seen through the lens of the camera" (Kracauer 295).</h5>
