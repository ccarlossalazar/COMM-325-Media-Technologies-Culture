<p class="fs-8 col-sm-6">We decided to approach this assignment by using horror as our genre of choice, 
    with our first video expressing the film concept of continuity. Continuity, 
    as we spoke in class, is expressed by creating the illusion of continuous time 
    and space as well as maintaining consistency in a film when it comes to editing 
    and camera shots. We spoke in class about continuity aiding in the process of 
    filmmaking to allow for a smooth transition and realistic feel to the audience.
     We chose to go with a syntactic approach to this assignment by using certain 
     elements from the horror genre and by applying many of the techniques in continuity. 
     Firstly, to set the scene we chose a dimly lit apartment which you can visually 
     see is empty to set the setting and atmosphere of the video. We included a 
     soundtrack in the back to help establish this spooky feeling throughout the 
     video to keep the audience engaged. For the opening scene of the video we chose 
     a longshot to capture the setting which is an apartment and getting the front door 
     as well as the main character in the shot. There are a number shots we use throughout 
     the video to aid in the continuity of our short film, consisting of medium shots, 
     close shots, and match on action shots. Similarly, the camera cuts we chose to go 
     with really made the video seem seamless and give the effect of ‘invisible cuts’ 
     while also adding to the overall horror genre and keeping the viewer on their toes. 
     We were able to also maintain consistency throughout the video for example, when 
     the main character turns on the lights or where she drops off her luggage when 
     running down the stairs.

    <p class="fs-8 col-sm-6">Once again for our montage video we are continuing with our genre 
        of horror and once again taking a similar approach to the previous video. When it 
        comes to montage in film you try to use quick cuts to establish a story. In our story
         we decided to do a montage of the main character searching the house because of a 
         suspicious noise and checking different areas of the house thoroughly. Once again 
         to set the setting and the atmosphere of our video we chose to have a dimly lit 
         setting with little to no light in the background. Similarly, we also chose a 
         different set of spooky music once again in the background to add a dramatic effect. 
         Montage in film is used to tell a story or give some backstory quickly. We used the
          opening scene from up as an example in class which is a great way to show how montage
           really works in film. This montage allowed for the reader to get some backstory on
            the main character and was able to set the tone for the film. Through the use of 
            jump cuts we were able to draw our own story of the main character looking for 
            something and quickly checking the entire house. After checking around the house 
            ultimately the main character ends up at the kitchen where he is met with his fate.
