        I chose to do my analysis on the original live action Transformers movie from 2007, 
        starring Shia LaBeouf, who plays Sam WitWicky and Megan Fox, who plays Mikaela Banes. 
        I chose this film because I am a fan of Science Fiction movies and this was a movie 
        I had not seen since I was a kid. It is a film that requires a lot of special effects 
        which is something that is good as it's a Science Fiction movie, but at the same time 
        it is an action film as well so there is a lot happening at once. The quick camera 
        cuts and fast switching of scenes makes it hard to follow during certain parts of the 
        film impacting the overall mise-en-scene. Upon reading Neale's work I agreed with his
        point about genre and genre being essentially an outdated term that can’t help and 
        explain a full story of a film. Not only this, but how films can take on multiple 
        genres and at the end of the day it is something that continues to evolve and instead 
        resort to using ‘film narrative’ to describe a film. Initially, I categorized
        Transformers simply as a science fiction and action film. However, I decided to look 
        up the genre of the film and found that there were an additional 3 which were also 
        adventure, comedy, and thriller. This began to make me think of what Neale was saying
         about genre and how, “each new genre film tends to extend this repertoire, either by
          adding a new element or by transgressing one of the old one’s” (Neale 167). He emphasizes 
          that variations within genres are essential for their growth and evolution as a whole. 
          Interestingly, in this film I also found examples of the male gaze, in the film where 
          Megan Fox is observing the engine bay of a car. This scene features multiple shots that 
          highlight her physical appearance, reflecting Laura Mulvey’s theory of the male gaze, 
          which suggests that films often objectify women to appeal to a male audience. One thing 
          I noticed about this film is that it could also in a way fall under the romance genre as 
          Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox end up growing closer as the movie progresses ultimately 
          until they end up together. This ties back into what I believe to be what genre says
           about a film and how a simple genre is too generic to be able to describe a film. 
           On the other hand, some could also argue that this film doesn’t fall under the genre 
           of romance due to the limited focus on romantic elements, highlighting the complexity 
           of genre classification in film. One scene I chose to analyze was one that was toward 
           the beginning of the film when the main character, Sam Witwicky meets Mikaela Banes for 
           the first time. I have included the clip and upon simply watching this clip it would 
           be hard to argue that the film has nothing to do with romance at all. However, to 
           Neal’s point, I believe this is sort of what he means as genre being an outdated term 
           and how genres sort of adopt new elements as they progress. What initially appeared
            to me to be a romantic part in the film is actually played for comedic effect, which 
            explains why the film is classified as a comedy rather than a romance. Throughout 
            their interactions, we see several instances where Sam’s awkwardness in flirting 
            provides humor and adds that comedic element to the film.

<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">"These examples all, of course, do more than indicate the process-like nature of individual genres. They also indicate the extent to which individual genres not only form part of a generic regime, but also themselves change, develop, and vary by borrowing from, and overlapping with, one another. (Neale 168)"</h5>
<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">“The process-like nature of genres manifests itself as an interaction between
    three levels: the level of expectation, the level of the generic corpus, and the level
    the "rules" or "norms" that govern both.” (Neale 165)</h5>
<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">“​​Texts which correspond to a particular understanding of the genre, that is, which provide ample material for a given method of analysis, will be retained within the generic corpus. Those which are not illuminated by the method developed in step three will simply be excluded from the final corpus. In terms of the musical, this would mean admitting that there are some films which include a significant amount of diegetic music, and yet which we will refuse to identify as musicals in the strong sense which the final corpus implies. (Neale 161 [Neal quoting Altman])</h5>
<h5 class="pt-2 pb-2">“​In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects its phantasy on to the female figure which is styled accordingly" (Mulvey 62)</h5>
